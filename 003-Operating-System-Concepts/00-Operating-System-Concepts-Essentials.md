Operating System Concepts
==========================

# 1. System Programming

## 1.1. System Calls

System Calls or `syscalls` are function calls made from user-space, in order to avail a feature from the Kernel the layers within kernel space.

Examples include a text editor reading/writing to a file on a filesystem within a disk. The disk requires a firware driver, a generic top-level driver such as SCSI, a filesystem driver etc.. which are all dealt within the kernel land.

All the system calls are documented under section 2 of the Linux manual pages. In order to read an introduction, please try:

```bash
# man 2 intro
```

To list all the system calls available on a Linux/Unix machine, execute:

```bash
# man syscalls
# man 2 syscalls
```

System calls may differ between system architecture, but in Linux a large percentage is common between varying architectures.

### 1.1.1. Issuing System calls

A system call is

## 1.3. The C compiler

# 2. APIs and ABIs

## 2.1. APIs

## 2.2. ABIs

# 3. Concepts of Linux Programming - Abstraction

Abstraction is a very important concept in Linux and System programming in general.

Any difficult concept can be easily represented with an abstraction layer on top of it.

The most commonly used abstraction models in Unix/Linux are:

* Files
* Process
* Users, Groups, and Permissions

## 3.1. Files and file systems

### 3.1.1. Regular files

### 3.1.2. Directories

### 3.1.3. Hard Links

### 3.1.4. Soft Links / Symbolic Links

### 3.1.5. Special files

### 3.1.6. Namespaces

## 3.2. Processes

## 3.3. Users and Groups

## 3.4. Permissions

## 3.5. Signals

## 3.6. Interprocess Communication
